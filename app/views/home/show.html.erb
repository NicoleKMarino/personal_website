  <h1> About Me:</h1>
  <hr class="square-light">
  <div class="home-p">
  I am a Junior Developer who recently graduated from Turing School of Software and Design in Denver. I'm a self motivated learner looking for an opportunity where I can create a connection between my technical skills and my experience with building a relationship with clients. Before attending Turing, I was a WordPress Developer for a small holistic health clinic in Colorado. I was comfortable in my position, but I wanted a challenge.
At Turing I learned how to use real world applicable skills such as Javascript & JQuery, Ruby on Rails, and much more. As a developer, I strive to make a positive impact on the teams I am apart of, and the field I contribute to. Not only does turing enforce good code standards, but also teaches it’s students a sense of community. I left with the ability to effectively paired program, set up student led sessions, and create a voice for social issues.
My passion drives me to come into work everyday with positivity and excitement with each new project.
